Dishant likes solving puzzles. Today he came across this one:

Given a tree where each node has a value assigned to it, find the maximum mean that can be obtained by considering values of any k-connected component of the given tree. 

A k-connected component in a tree is a subtree of the given tree which contains exactly k nodes.

You need to output the floor value of maximum mean that can be obtained for all possible values of k. Can you help him solve this puzzle?

Input:

The first line contains a single integer n denoting the total number of nodes in the tree. The next n - 1 lines contains 2 space seperated integers u and v denoting there is an edge between the two nodes. The last line contains n space seperated integers which denote values assigned to each node. Lets denote this by c[N].

Output:

Output n space seperated integer where kth integer denotes maximum mean for k-connected componets. (1 <= k <= N)

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 5 x 103

0 <= u, v < N

-105 <= c[i] <= 105  for all valid i




1-connected components: Every node in itself is 1-connected component of given tree. Hence, the answer will be 5.

2-connected components: All the two connected components are : (0, 1), (0, 2) and (0, 3) whose mean values are 3.5, 4, 2.5 respectively. Since we are interested in floor values, mean values turn out to be 3, 4 and 2 out of which we select 4 as it is maximum.

3-connected components: All the three connected components are : (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3) and (0, 2, 3) whose mean values are 3.33, 2.33 and 2.67 respectively. Taking floor values, it turns out to be 3, 2 and 2. Thus, our answer will be 3.

4-connected components: There is only a single 4-connected component i.e. the whole tree. Thus, answer turns out to be 3.
