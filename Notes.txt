Use HLD when required to update something in path between u and v and query related to it.
Use Euler when queries and updates are related to subtree of some vertex v.

** DSU(MST application) : Brilliant question - https://codeforces.com/contest/1081/problem/D
    How to solve? Construct a MST. It is clear that the maximum "cost" of path between any two nodes will always be present in MST. So, run Prim's algo from any spcl node. We get the answer : https://codeforces.com/contest/1081/submission/47148263
